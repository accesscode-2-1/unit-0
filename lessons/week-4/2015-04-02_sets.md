# Objectives

To learn about `Set`:
- What is a `Set`, i.e. how it differs from say `List`.
- How to add and remove values.
- How to use `keySet`.

# Sets

> *Definition:* A *set* is a collection that contains no duplicate elements.

What's an example of a set? An alphabet is a set:

```
a b c d e f g ...
```

Or here is some Hiragana:

```
あ い う え お
```

# Set vs List

How is a set different from a list?

| | List | Set |
|---|---|---|
| Unique | No | Yes |
| Ordered | Yes | Depends |
| Indexable | Yes | No |

# Java's Set

There are a few ways to make a set in Java. Today, we'll be using `HashSet` ([documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashSet.html)). With `HashSet`, order is not guaranteed.

You import it like this:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
```

Today, let's start with an empty `HashSet`. Call it `odd`.

```java
HashSet<Integer> odd = new HashSet<Integer>();
```

#### add

You add objects to a set using `add`:

```java
odd.add(1);
odd.add(3);
odd.add(57);
```

> **Exercise:** Your `odd` set is empty. Add some odd numbers!

#### for each

You can iterate over a set using a `for each` loop:

```java
for (Intger num : odds) {
}
```

> **Exercise:** Create a new `HashSet` called `even` with only even numbers. Use a `for each` loop to add all the numbers in `odd` to `even`.

#### remove

You remove an object by calling `remove`:

```java
odd.remove(3);
```

> **Exercise:** Undo what you just did: remove all the odd numbers from `even`.

#### addAll, removeAll

These are two useful methods. They add every element from one set into another, retaining uniqueness. Here's `addAll`:

```java
// odd = [1,3,5]
// even = [2,4,6]
odd.addAll(even); // [1,2,3,4,6,7]
```

Here's `removeAll`:

```java
// nums1 = [1,3,5]
// nums2 = [1,2,4]
nums1.addAll(nums2); // [2,4]
```

#### contains, size, isEmpty

Sets also have our standard methods: `contains`, `size`, and `isEmpty`.

```java
odd.contains(1); // true
```

#### Cloning a set

An easy way to clone a set is to just pass the set you want to copy into the constructor:

```java
HashSet<Integer> odd2 = new HashSet<Integer>(odd);
HashSet<Integer> odd3 = new HashSet<Integer>(odd);
System.out.println(odd2 == odd2);
System.out.println(odd2 == odd3);
System.out.println(odd2.equals(odd3));
```

#### keySet

We've actually already used a set before, when iterating over the values in a `HashMap`. Let's look at that again:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
fruitCount.put("bananas", 3);
fruitCount.put("apples", 99);
for (String fruit : fruitCount.keySet()) {
    System.out.println(fruit);
}
```

In the above code, `keySet()` is return a set of `String` objects. We are looping over that set.

# In-class exercises: analyze our social network

Please work through these exercises using [this stencil file](/in-class%20exercise%20solutions/SocialNetwork.java). Complete as many as you can in class.

1. **Implement `allFriends`:** A union of two sets is the set of all things that are members of either. Here is a visual:

  ![Union](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Venn0111.svg)

  `allFriends` friends should return a new set that contains all the friends in `yours` and all the friends in `mine`.

1. **Implement `mutualFriends`:** An intersection is the set of all things that are members of both sets.

    ![Intersection](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Venn0001.svg)

  `mutualFriends` friends should return a new set that contains just the friends that are in both `yours` and `mine`.

1. **Implement `justYourFriends`:** A complement is the set of all elements that are members of one set but not another.

  ![Complement](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Venn0100.svg)
  
  `justYourFriends` friends should return a new set that contains just the friends that are in both `yours`. If any friends in `mine` are also in `yours`, do not add them to the set returned.

1. **Implement `justMyFriends`:** This is just like `justYourFriends` but returns only the friends in `mine` rather than `yours`. Can you think of an easy way to do this?

1. **Implement `exclusiveFriends`:** The symmetric difference is the set of things which are in either of two sets but not in their intersection.

  ![Difference](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Venn0110.svg)

1. **Implement `yourFriendsAreMine`:** A set is a subset of another if every thing in the first set is also in the second. Here, `A` is a subset of `B`:

  ![Subset](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Venn_A_subset_B.svg)
  
  `yourFriendsAreMine` should return `true` only if all the friends in `yours` are also in `mine`. `mine` can have friends that are not in `yours`.
  
1. **(Bonus) Implement `matchmaker`:** Calculate all possible matches between your friends and return a `HashSet` of `HashSet` of `String` objects.
