- Discuss prerequistes:
- Discuss how the internet works
- Making web requests
- What are web APIs
- What are mashups
- what is json                                                           
- why should we care


## Early morning hacking assignment
Today is your first day on the job as chief technology officer at PS.123 in flushing. 
Judy, your boss and acting principal greets you as soon as you walk in and gets you working right away. She tells you 
that she needs a way to represent the "principle to teacher to student relationships" in such a way that she can 
later extract meaningful data from this data.

She's provided a diagram which shows these relationships.

![ principal to teacher to student relationship tree ]  (https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-0/blob/master/images/principle_teacher_student_items_relationship.jpg)

She's also gone ahead and created a skeleton for you which is available @ https://github.com/davisRoman/hierarchy

Open the project ( Don't import! ) and help Judy find the best way to represent these relationships. 

Note: Don't forget to also implement the empty methods in the Principal class.



## The Internet ( in 30 seconds or less )

- A publicly accessible remote machine that consists of an infinite amount of cat pictures.

## What are web APIs

## Combing various APIs -  Mashups

## What is `JSON`
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.  JSON is a lightweight data-interchange
format and it allows you to store and create data. It’s not a programming language. It’s not a markup language. 

So, what does that mean? To put it simply, it’s a file with data formatted to be readable by other programming languages.

While JSON isn’t really a language or can actually do anything on it’s own, it can be useful with data transportation. For example, 
let’s say you had a list of users and you wanted to send this data across various languages like PHP and JavaScript. Naturally, 
these are 2 different languages, but both languages understand JSON. By bridging this gap, you can make it easy to send data 
from one language to the other. 

### Advantages of using JSON:
There are no reserved words in JSON
It’s shorter to write
Human Readable and Defined
Extremely lightweight, making it run faster than XML

### Simple Example
'''
{
   "name"      : "Ray Villalobos",
   "position"  : "Staff Author",
   "courses"   : [
      "Javascript and AJAX",
      "Building Facebook Applications",
      "jQuery Mobile Web Apps"
      ]
}
```

### Complicated example
```
{
"problems": [{
    "Diabetes":[{
        "medications":[{
            "medicationsClasses":[{
                "className":[{
                    "associatedDrug":[{
                        "name":"asprin",
                        "dose":"",
                        "strength":"500 mg"
                    }],
                    "associatedDrug#2":[{
                        "name":"somethingElse",
                        "dose":"",
                        "strength":"500 mg"
                    }]
                }],
                "className2":[{
                    "associatedDrug":[{
                        "name":"asprin",
                        "dose":"",
                        "strength":"500 mg"
                    }],
                    "associatedDrug#2":[{
                        "name":"somethingElse",
                        "dose":"",
                        "strength":"500 mg"
                    }]
                }]
            }]
        }],
        "labs":[{
            "missing_field": "missing_value"
        }]
    }],
    "Asthma":[{}]
}]
}
```
